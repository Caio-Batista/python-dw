# Python Design Wizard

## Requiriments

### Python version over version 2.x
This version of Python Design Wizard uses (mainly) the [AST](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ast.html) api from the Python 2.x lib. It also runs with the [3.x version](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/ast.html) of the api, but it was not the focus of this project so it may have some issues in some cases e.g.: Print, dict and calls entities.  

## Introduction 

### What is it?
The Python Design Wizard is a tool, and also an api, that uses the AST (Abstract syntax tree) of Python to find anti-patterns or violations* in Python programs without having to run them in anyway.
